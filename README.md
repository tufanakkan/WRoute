# WRoute

Planning a road trip with your car but wonder "how's the weather today". Well you can look for it but there are multiple locations on your route. That could take a while. With WRoute set a route and see all the weather conditions on your route instantly.

NOTE: This is an unfinished project and you can see my code in this path https://github.com/tufanakkan/WRoute/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/wroute 

I have a problem with the core algorithm that calculates the checkpoints on the route. I am open to any new ideas about that.

Here's a link for APK file https://github.com/tufanakkan/WRoute/blob/master/app-debug.apk

This program targeted API 26 (Android 8.0) and there's a problem with higher versions of Android currently.
